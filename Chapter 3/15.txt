In this task I played around with some hex values. We read the number from the standart input, then in a new variable we store bits 3,4 and 5 exactly as they are.
We do so with the & operator and the hex value 0x1c (16 base numbering system), as I understand it, depending on the operating system means
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001 1100 - 32bit, double the bits for a 64bit OS, and so on.
We then shift those bits 21 positions to the left, so now the 3,4,5 bits are the 24,25,26 bits respectively.
We do the same for the 24,25,26 bits using the & operator and the hex value 0x3800000 and then shifting them 21 positions to the right.

We make sure that the 3,4,5,24,25,26 bits in the original number are made to 0 using the & operator and the hex value 0xFC7FFFE3 which has all 1's except for those positions.
Then using the temporary variables and the or | operator we set the bits to what the task requires of us.
